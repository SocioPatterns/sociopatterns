We have three new SocioPatterns experiments in the pipeline. The first will be deployed at the <a href="https://2009.eswc-conferences.org">2009 European Semantic Web Conference</a> from May 31st to June 4th, in Heraklion, Greece. This deployment will focus on the integration of the real-time social interaction data with semantic data on the on-line social networks of the participants.

The second will be deployed at the 20ème Congrès de la <a href="https://www.sf2h.net">Société Française d'Hygiène Hospitalière</a> on June 4th and 5th in Nice, France. This deployment aims to demonstrate the SocioPatterns platform and its ability to collect highly detailed data on the social interactions in a large-scale setting.

The third experiment will be deployed at the <a href="http://www.ht2009.org/">ACM Hypertext 2009</a> conference from June 29th to July 1sr, at Villa Gualino in Torino, Italy.
