If you already know a thing or two about Adobe Flash/Flex, Processing/Python or SuperCollider/Max/MSP, and you want to seize this unique opportunity to apply your skills in a two-day 'Hack-a-Thon' workshop to visualize/sonorize the SocioPatterns data stream at the Science Gallery- this is the workshop for you! This event is a hands-on exploration of possible ways of visualizing and/or sonorizing the live data-stream from the SocioPatterns deployment in the INFECTIOUS exhibition. In addition, you may be able to apply your own Arduino magic given the live data feed from the SocioPatterns deployment at the gallery by using Open Sound Control signals which Arduino can receive when connected to the network or over Wireless or Bluetooth. Arduino can, given these signals, do all kinds of stuff, like triggering blinking lights.

Basic libraries for tapping into the live data stream for each of these platforms will be provided. During the workshop, participants will be able to tap into the live data stream from the SocioPatterns deployment at the Science Gallery. Given that the participants will only have access to the live stream during the workshop, the idea is to have finished pieces by the end of the workshop. It is necessary that all participants think about what they want to do beforehand, and even pre-develop basic artwork to be used during the workshop.

This workshop is free, but you need to reserve <a href="http://www.sciencegallery.com/">here</a> (hurry, because we've heard that there are only a few places left...)
