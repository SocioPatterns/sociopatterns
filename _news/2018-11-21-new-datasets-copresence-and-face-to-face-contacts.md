Through <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0140-1">a publication in EPJ Data Science</a>, we have released several new data sets of different types. These datasets can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1117883">Zenodo</a>.

On the one hand, we have released new temporally resolved data on face-to-face interactions collected in
<ul>
 	<li>the SFHH scientific conference held in 2009, with more than 400 participants to the data collection, a data set that we have already used in several publications such as <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-9-87">Simulation of an SEIR infectious disease model on the dynamic contact network of conference attendees</a></li>
 	<li>an office building (InVS, French Health observatory) in 2015 (following a first data collection performed in 2013, published <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/data-on-facetoface-contacts-in-an-office-building-suggest-a-lowcost-vaccination-strategy-based-on-community-linkers/18AB49AB4F2AEA33CE7501F06ADBC8E8">here</a>). This data set contains also metadata, i.e., to which department each individual belongs.</li>
</ul>
In addition, we release data sets describing the temporally resolved co-location of individuals, where co-location of two individuals at time t means that the same exact set of readers have received signals from both individuals at time t. Data can be found on our <a href="/datasets/co-location-data-for-several-sociopatterns-data-sets/">website</a> or on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1117883">Zenodo</a>.

Obviously, the co-location data corresponds to a coarser spatial resolution than the face-to-face data, and we have compared the corresponding data in terms of structure and when used in data-driven simulations of disease propagation models in our <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0140-1">paper</a>.
