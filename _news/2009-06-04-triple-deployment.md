We're proud to announce that today we had three simultaneous SocioPatterns experiments successfully up and running in three different countries. One experiment has been running for more than six weeks at the <a href="http://www.sciencegallery.com">Science Gallery</a> in Dublin, Ireland, the second has been running for the last couple of days at the <a href="https://2009.eswc-conferences.org">2009 European Semantic Web Conference</a> conference in Heraklion, Greece, and the third started today at the 20ème Congrès de la <a href="https://www.sf2h.net">Société Française d’Hygiène Hospitalière</a> in Nice, France.
