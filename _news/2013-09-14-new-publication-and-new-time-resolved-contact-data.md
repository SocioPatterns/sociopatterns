We have just published a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073970">new paper</a> in PLoS ONE, titled "Estimating Potential Infection Transmission Routes in Hospital Wards Using Wearable Proximity Sensors". This paper describes the properties of the contact patterns between patients, patients and health-care workers (HCWs) and among HCWs in a hospital ward in Lyon, France, from Monday, December 6, 2010 at 1:00 pm to Friday, December 10, 2010 at 2:00 pm. The study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients.

In addition, we release the corresponding time-resolved dataset. The dataset is available <a href="/datasets/hospital-ward-dynamic-contact-network/">here</a> as a tab-separated list of contacts during 20-second intervals of the data collection, and also in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073970#s5">GEXF format</a> as a supplementary information of the published paper.
