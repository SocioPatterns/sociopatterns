Representations of geographic and urban spaces that host human activities have become readily available. However, the representation of the social and dynamical aspects of the human interactions that take place in those spaces is lagging behind. Similarly, topological representations of online social networks have been explored, but those concerning dynamical aspects less so.

In order to better understand the opportunities, problems and issues related to the representation of dynamical processes and networks, we organize a workshop in the context of <a href="/news/2011/04/imera-art-science-residency/">our IMéRA residency</a> on "Data-driven Exploration of Dynamical Networks". This workshop brings together researchers and designers that work on complex contexts such as inter-personal contacts, interaction and information networks in social media, urban mobility and infection or opinion dynamics.
