A <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/9/87/abstract">new study of ours has been published in BMC Medicine</a>, with <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/9/88/abstract">a commentary by Sally Blower and Myong-Hyun Go</a>. In this paper we simulated a SEIR process on the dynamical network of human proximity recorded through the  SocioPatterns sensing platform. We report on the implications of using high-resolution dynamic social network data on modeling epidemic processes.
