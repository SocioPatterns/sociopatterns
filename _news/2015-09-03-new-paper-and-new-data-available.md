We have just published a new paper in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136497">PLoS ONE</a>. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison between various types of data describing contacts and relationships between students in a high school: data collected from wearable sensors, data from contact diaries and data from surveys in which students were asked to name their friends. 

We release <strong>all the corresponding data</strong> both in the Supplementary Information of the paper and in the <a href="/datasets/high-school-contact-and-friendship-networks/">SocioPatterns page dedicated to data</a>.
