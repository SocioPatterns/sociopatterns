Since the beginning of the past week, we have been running a pilot experiment in 
<a href="http://www.ospedalebambinogesu.it/">a major Italian pediatric hospital</a>, 
in a collaboration with the hospital and the <a href="http://www.iss.it">ISS</a>. 
The experiment involves patients, doctors, healthcare workers and visitors, simultaneously 
collecting contact information and clinical information. We aim at measuring 
epidemiologically relevant quantities in a real-world healthcare setting.
