We have presented a wealth of new data, analysis and results at the annual <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-29228-1">European Conference on Complex Systems ECCS'14</a> held in Lucca from Sept. 22 to 26, 2014. Contributed talks were given by A. Barrat, M. Génois, C. Vestergaard and L. Gauvin. R. Mastrandrea also presented preliminary results at the TNETS'14 satellite.
Moreover, A. Barrat and C. Cattuto gave invited talks at the "Computational Social Science satellite workshop". Finally, we were glad to see various talks by scientists who used SocioPatterns data sets.
