We have launched a pilot study in collaboration with <strong>Laura Ozella</strong> and her team at the <strong>University of Torino</strong>, Italy.  We aim at instrumenting <strong>colonies of feral cats</strong> in the city of Torino with <a href="http://get.openbeacon.org/" target="_blank">new proximity sensors</a> programmed by the ISI Data Science Lab to operate in a fully distributed fashion. We will measure the <strong>social structure of feral cat colonies in urban settings</strong>, and put these data in relation to <strong>clinical and microbiological data</strong> on cats' health and transmissible conditions. This pilot study is part of a <a href="http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2014/05/15/news/i_gatti_sentinelle_dell_inquinamento_a_torino-86216754/" target="_blank">broader study on animal health and environmental risk factors</a> led by Laura Ozella.
