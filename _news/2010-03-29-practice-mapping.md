A new artscience project called Practice Mapping will be using the SocioPatterns platform during a workshop co-organized by LABoral and Medialab-Prado. The project aims to investigate the interaction dynamics of the creative process. It wants to make visible the network of interactions between the concerned people, objects and work tools, relevant locations in and around the workshop, and relevant events as logged by the participants. It intends to blend scientific data collection and analysis techniques, with artistic reinterpretation methodologies in order to build a visual narrative of these interaction dynamics, linking different representations in a system of maps.

The Practice Mapping project is one of the projects that will be developed during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100323093633/http://www2.laboralcentrodearte.org/article/convocatoria_de_colaboradores_interactivos_el_proceso_como_paradigma">Interactivos? LABoral: When Process Becomes Paradigm</a> workshop. Artists, designers, sociologists, ethnographers, or other interested parties are invited to join this effort as workshop participants from 8 till 20 April at LABoral in Gijon, Spain.
