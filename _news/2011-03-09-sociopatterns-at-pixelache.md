The <a href="http://www.pixelache.ac/helsinki/festival-2011/">Pixelache Festival</a> got started today on the <a href="http://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/">Suomenlinna island</a> in Helsinki, Finland. SocioPatterns is well represented by Wouter Van den Broeck. On thursday he will lead one of the three tracks in the <a href="https://www.pixelache.ac/events/mapping-in-progress-workshop">MAPPING IN PROGRESS</a> workshop, which will focus on the cultural roles of <em>mapping</em>. On friday he will give a talk in the <a href="https://www.pixelache.ac/events/map-me-if-you-will-seminar">MAP ME IF YOU WILL</a> seminar, discussing the opportunities and challenges of a <em>data-driven</em> society, and the role of <em>mapping</em> in these. Finally, the <a href="/gallery/infectious-sociopatterns-poster/">SIXTY-NINE DAYS OF CLOSE ENCOUNTERS AT THE SCIENCE GALLERY</a> visualization will be shown in the "Camp Pixelache" exhibition, while "the making of" will be discussed in a presentation on Saturday.
