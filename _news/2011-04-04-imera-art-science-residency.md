Ciro Cattuto, Wouter Van den Broeck and Marco Quaggiotto will spend the month of April in Marseille for a residency at the<strong> Aix-Marseille Institute for Advanced Study (IMéRA)</strong>, together with Alain Barrat from the CPT in Marseille. The work at IMéRA will focus on a broad art-science look at dynamical network data, and will include a public workshop with high-profile experts in the field, that will be announced later this week.
