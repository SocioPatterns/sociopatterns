We are thrilled to announce that the long time hardware partners of the SocioPatterns collaboration, <strong>Brita Meriac</strong> and <strong>Milosch Meriac</strong> of <a href="http://www.bitmanufaktur.de/" target="_blank">Bitmanufaktur</a> and <a href="http://www.openbeacon.org/" target="_blank">OpenBeacon</a>, <strong><a href="http://get.openbeacon.org/" target="_blank">have open sourced the design of their latest BLE beacons</a></strong>. The new beacons already support the recently announced <a href="http://google.github.io/physical-web/" target="_blank">Physical Web</a> protocol by Google. We look forward to a surging wave of <em>open sociometrics</em>.
