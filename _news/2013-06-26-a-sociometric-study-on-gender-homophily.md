Today we release a new manuscript based on the PhD work of Juliette Stehlé and the behavioral data we collected in a <a href="/datasets/primary-school-cumulative-networks/">primary school</a> using the SocioPatterns proximity sensors. The manuscript, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5961">Gender homophily from spatial behavior in a primary school: a sociometric study</a> , uses high-resolution proximity data among children to investigate gender homophily, its evolution with children age, and its dependence on tie strength.
