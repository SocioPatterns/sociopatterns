We have just published a <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/14/695" target="_blank">new paper in BMC Infectious Diseases</a> where we compare different strategies for epidemic mitigation in a primary school and investigate the performance of targeted class-closure interventions.

In the Supplementary Information of the paper, <strong>we release a dataset on the face-to-face interactions in a primary school</strong>, measured by using wearable proximity sensors. The dataset covers <strong>over 200 persons (students and teachers)</strong> for about 2 days, and provides not only a complex temporal network, but also the <strong>ground truth for communities</strong>, i.e., a school class attribute for all nodes in the network. Enjoy!
