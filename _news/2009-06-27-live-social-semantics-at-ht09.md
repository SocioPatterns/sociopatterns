Following up on the success of the Live Social Semantics experiment at the European Semantic Web Conference 2009 in Greece, we will deploy a <em>new experiment</em> at <a href="http://www.ht2009.org" target="_blank">Hypertext 2009</a> in Torino, from Monday 29th to July 1st. HT09 attendees will be able to experience an application that mashes up real-world social contacts and on-line friendships and interests, in real time.
