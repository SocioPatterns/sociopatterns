On April 18h, a workshop organized by the <a href="http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a> explored the state of the art on "Social Contacts and Mixing Patterns in Epidemiology", focusing on measurement techniques and field experiences. Ciro Cattuto was invited to give a talk on the experience of the SocioPatterns project in measuring dynamical networks of human contact. Thanks to Ken Eames and John Edmunds for a very stimulating meeting!
