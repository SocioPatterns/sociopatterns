We have published a <a href="/gallery/infectious-sociopatterns-poster/">visualization</a> of sixty-nine days of face-to-face contact activity among more than 30,000 persons based on data collected during the <a href="/deployments/infectious-sociopatterns/">INFECTIOUS: STAY AWAY exhibition</a> in the Science Gallery in Dublin, Ireland. This visualization is published in our <a href="/gallery/">gallery</a> as a poster that can be freely downloaded.
