On December 26-30th we deployed a new SocioPatterns experiment at the <a title="25C3" href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/" target="_blank">25th Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin</a> (25C3). This is the first large-scale deployment of our platform for sensing social interactions. We added to the visualization interface several ways of focusing on particular subsets of the real-time and cumulative contact networks. In line with the conference's action line <em>"nothing to hide"</em>, we made the live contact network available on the web.

We <strong>thank</strong> the following persons for their work and support: <strong>Milosch Meriac, Brita Meriac, and aestetix, Janette Lehmann, Aurora Mazzone, Marco Perosa, Eric Preston, Tomasz Rybak</strong>. Our work at 25C3 was carried out in the context of a broader tracking event by the <a title="OpenBeacon" href="http://openbeacon.org" target="_blank">OpenBeacon project</a> and the <a title="OpenAMD" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130701084419/http://www.openamd.org/" target="_blank">OpenAMD project</a>, with hardware and infrastructure provided by <a href="http://www.bitmanufaktur.de">Bitmanufaktur</a>. We also thank the organizers of 25C3 for hosting our work at such a stimulating event!

Visualizations, movies and results from the data collected at 25C3 will be posted to this blog in the next few weeks.
