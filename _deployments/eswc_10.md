<h1>Event description</h1>
The mission of the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2010) is to bring together researchers and practioners dealing with different aspects of semantics on the Web. ESWC2010 builds on the success of the former European Semantic Web Conference series, but seeks to extend its focus by engaging with other communities within and outside ICT, in which semantics can play an important role. At the same time, ESWC2010 is a truly international conference. [source: <a href="http://www.eswc2010.org/">ESWC 2010 website</a>]

<h1>Deployment description</h1>
This deployment was the third performed in the context of the [link id="451"]Live Social Semantics[/link] (LSS) project. The [link id="499"]first LSS deployment[/link] took place the previous edition of the same conference at the same venue. This deployment consequently provided us with a unique opportunity to compare the results of this deployment with the one of the previous year.

One of the differences in the system with respect to the previous year was that we added Twitter to the online social systems LSS took into consideration, but removed Flickr, Delicious and LastM. We also designed and developed a new web-interface that was simpler, more user friendly, and integrated more closely with Facebook through the use of newly available APIs.

You can find more information on the research objectives and methods of this deployment on the [link id="451"]Live Social Semantics project page[/link].
