<h1>Event description</h1>

The <a href="http://www.ht2009.org/">20th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia</a> was held in Torino, Italy. This annual conference is the foremost international conference on hypertext and hypermedia. It brings together scholars, researchers and practitioners from a diverse array of disciplines, united by a shared interest in innovative textual and multimedia information spaces – with emphasis on augmenting human capabilities via linking, structure, authoring, annotation and interaction. In addition to the established conference themes, the conference is actively exploring ideas at the intersection of hypermedia and Digital Libraries, Software Engineering and the Humanities. Submissions are welcomed on the representation, design, structuring, visualizing, navigating, and exploiting of the rich network of relationships found in these domains. [source: the <a href="http://www.sigweb.org/conferences/ht-cover.shtml">Hypertext conference website</a>]
