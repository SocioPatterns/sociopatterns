H-networks, coordinated by Ca' Foscari University of Venice in collaboration with the ISI Foundation, has the aim to reconstruct personal interaction pattern in a highly innovative organization such as H-Farm.

H-Farm people, infact, must wear, every day, at work, a badge with an RFID device detect  that  reveals the contact time between two people that are wearing it.

During the last week of the project there was a news too. On the big screen in the Silos cafè infact, was possible to see, in real time, the H-Farm people connection!
