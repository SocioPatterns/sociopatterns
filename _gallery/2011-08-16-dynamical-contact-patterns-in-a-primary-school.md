This movie represents the dynamical contacts network measured during one day of activity in a primary school. Nodes represent individuals, and edges indicate face-to-face contacts. Every frame shows the contact network over a time window of 20 minutes. Nodes are arranged in groups that correspond to the school classes, with the teacher node at the center. Nodes are color-coded according to the grade  and teachers are shown in black.
