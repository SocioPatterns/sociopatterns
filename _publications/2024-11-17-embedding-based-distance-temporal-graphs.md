  Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.
