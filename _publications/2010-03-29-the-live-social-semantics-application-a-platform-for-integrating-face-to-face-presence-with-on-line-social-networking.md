  We describe a novel application that integrates real-world data on the face-to-face proximity of individuals with their identities and contacts in on-line social networks. This application was successfully deployed at two conference gatherings, ESWC09 and HT2009, and actively used by hundreds of people. Personal proﬁles of the participants were automatically generated using several Web 2.0 systems and semantic data sources, and integrated in real-time with face-toface proximity relations detected using RFID-enabled badges. The integration of these heterogeneous data sources enables various services that enhance the experience of conference attendees, allowing them to explore their social neighborhood and to connect with other participants. This paper describes the architecture of the application, the services we provided, and the results we achieved in these deployments.
