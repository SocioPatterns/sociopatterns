  Today,  many  people  spend  a  lot  of  time  online. Their social interactions captured in online social networks are an important part of the overall personal social profile, in addition to interactions taking place offline. This paper investigates whether relations  captured  by  online  social  networks  can  be  used  as  a proxy for the relations in offline social networks, such as networks of  human  face-to-face  (F2F)  proximity  and  coauthorship  networks. Particularly, the paper focuses on interactions of computer scientists  in  online  settings  (homepages,  social  networks  profiles and connections) and offline settings (scientific collaboration, face-to-face  communications  during  the  conferences).  We  focus  on quantitative studies: we investigate the structural similarities and correlations  of  the  induced  networks;  in  addition,  we  analyze implications between networks. Finally, we provide a qualitative user analysis to find characteristics of good and bad proxies.
