  We describe the experimental deployment of a network of wearable sensors that allows the tracking of the location and mutual proximity of individuals in a hospital ward, in real time and at a large scale. In the course of the deployment, all individuals accessing the premises were monitored for a period of one week, including health care personnel, patients, visitors and tutors. The data collected yields a rich dynamical picture of the contact patterns between individuals and between categories of individuals. As an example, here we show that by constructing a cumulative weighted contact network aggregating the dynamical data on the entire duration of the deployment, it is possible to reliably uncover persistent relations among individuals.
