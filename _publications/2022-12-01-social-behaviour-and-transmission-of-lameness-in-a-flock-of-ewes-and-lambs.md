  Sheep have heterogeneous social connections that influence transmission of some infectious diseases. Footrot is one of the top five globally important diseases of sheep, it is caused by Dichelobacter nodosus and transmits between sheep when infectious feet contaminate surfaces e.g. pasture. Surfaces remain infectious for a few minutes to a few days, depending on surface moisture levels. Susceptible sheep in close social contact with infectious sheep might be at risk of becoming infected because they are likely to step onto infectious footprints, particularly dams and lambs, as they cluster together. High resolution proximity sensors were deployed on 40 ewes and their 54 lambs aged 5–27 days, in a flock with endemic footrot in Devon, UK for 13 days. Sheep locomotion was scored daily by using a 0–6 integer scale. Sheep were defined lame when their locomotion score (LS) was ≥ 2, and a case of lameness was defined as LS ≥ 2 for ≥ 2 days. Thirty-two sheep (19 ewes, 9 single, and 4 twin lambs) became lame during the study, while 14 (5 ewes, 5 single, and 4 twin lambs) were lame initially. The 46 sheep were from 29 family groups; transmission from ewes to lambs was bidirectional. At least 15% of new cases of footrot were attributed to within-family transmission; the occurrence of lameness was higher in single lambs than twin lambs. Estimates suggest at least 4% of transmission resulted from close contact across the flock. Non-family sheep spent only ~0.03 hours/day in contact with others outside their family; lamb-dam contact times were higher in single lambs (≈1.5 h/day) than twin lambs (≈0.9 h/day), which may explain the family-clustered lameness pattern observed. We conclude that while most transmission of lameness is not attributable to close contact alone, for ewes with young lambs some transmission occurs within family groups — likely due to the prolonged contact between lambs and their dam.
