  Temporal networks of face-to-face interactions between individuals are useful proxies of the dynamics of social systems on fast timescales. Several empirical statistical properties of these networks have been shown to be robust across a large variety of contexts. To better grasp the role of various mechanisms of social interactions in the emergence of these properties, models in which schematic implementations of such mechanisms can be carried out have proven useful. Here, we put forward a framework to model temporal networks of human interactions based on the idea of a coevolution and feedback between (i) an observed network of instantaneous interactions and (ii) an underlying unobserved social bond network: Social bonds partially drive interaction opportunities and in turn are reinforced by interactions and weakened or even removed by the lack of interactions. Through this coevolution, we also integrate in the model well-known mechanisms such as triadic closure, but also the impact of shared social context and nonintentional (casual) interactions, with several tunable parameters. We then propose a method to compare the statistical properties of each version of the model with empirical face-to-face interaction data sets to determine which sets of mechanisms lead to realistic social temporal networks within this modeling framework.
