  The social environment experienced by livestock can have implications for their health, welfare, and subsequently, their productivity. Yet few studies have assessed the putative impact of positive cow-cow interactions, such as proximity to preferred herd mates and engaging in grooming, on milk production and udder health. To address this, we used cattle proximity as a proxy for affiliative interactions between cows in three dairy herds in south-west England over one week study periods. We created proximity networks of dairy cows and measured cow-cow associations according to milk yield, somatic cell count (SCC; an indicator of mastitis), parity (number of lactations in the cow's lifetime), and lactation stage (grouped by days in milk for current lactation). We then assessed associations between social factors and production and health measures (milk yield and SCC). In all three herds, cows interacted more with cows in the same parity, suggesting early social bonding may be evident later in life and that grouping animals in terms of parity might encourage affiliative interactions. However, there was no link between milk yield or SCC and time spent near other cows or near preferred cows, suggesting that these factors of the social environment are not associated with production or udder health.
